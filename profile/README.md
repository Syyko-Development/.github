# Syyko Development

Syyko Development builds clean, modular tooling for FiveM servers with a
focus on maintainability, performance, and developer experience.

## Projects
- **Syyko Core** — A clean, modular FiveM framework (early development)

## Philosophy
We believe frameworks should be:
- Predictable
- Explicit
- Modular
- Built to scale

Opinionated where it matters. Flexible where it counts.
